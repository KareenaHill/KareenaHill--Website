        Despite my best efforts to conserve money, my earnings as a young college student are continually declining. One of the many life lessons I've learned while attending college and as a young adult is how challenging it can be to integrate the demands of my financial obligations with those of my personal and academic obligations. I never seem to have a reliable income.  
Many students now find it very challenging to manage their finances, which has caused reductions in their academic performance, issues with their mental health, and unexpected compromises that shouldn't be forced onto them. In response to this, institutions do need to devise a solution that can teach students how to effectively manage their money while also providing options that are universally affordable and fall within the budget of college students, whether that be the cost of tuition, supplies, or even living to address this systemic issue.
I am not the only student who struggles to meet basic needs; according to a recent study, at least 40% of college students struggle to pay for tuition and other expenses. 60% of college students, according to the same study, claimed they wouldn't even be able to cover unforeseen costs like car maintenance and medical bills (Leonhardt, M. 2020). To further clarify, the impact of such demanding charges causes students to struggle to maintain both their academic responsibilities and mental health. According to the results of a financial survey, half of the college students "admitted to neglecting their schoolwork‚Äù at least to an extent because of the money they owed. In addition to what I mentioned regarding mental health, BetterYou's Heidi Zwart finds that financial stress can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues (Scholarship America. 2019). As a result of that, many students take out loans to assist ease their financial responsibilities and prevent dropping out, but this puts them in a terrible, dark position after they graduate‚Äîthe very reverse of what education is meant to provide. How do institutions expect students to work and learn to the best of their ability when they have to spend more time working just to be able to afford to go to class? One student Crystal Cox junior at the University of Missouri states that she had to choose between going to class or being able to afford to eat. US college systems as a whole should no longer allow the price to learn to be more expensive than the price to live. cite.
The idea of budgeting or adhering to a budget just does not seem feasible to students given that they are constantly making purchases with their money. Students cannot save money as they are constantly paying for expenses, and there is a substantial difference in the outflow of money compared to the inflow. The main causes of student indebtedness include unexpected expenses (51%), a lack of financial aid (49%), expensive textbooks along costly tuition(49) (Jerilyn Klein Bier. n.d.). Even though a lot of people, including institutions, might believe this to be a trivial issue, it is not.  According to Annamaria Lusardi of CNBC, student loan debt is America's second-largest debt market behind mortgages. (NBCUniversal News Group. 2022). Long-term, students will have to continue working and paying bills beyond their pay grade while repaying hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.  As a result, institutions must implement cost-free alternatives for a complete college education.
